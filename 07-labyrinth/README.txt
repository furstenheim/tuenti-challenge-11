Hello, dear friend. Do you feel like you're in some kind of jail? Did you wake up this morning with the feeling that everything was dark?

Well, it isn't a dream. You're really here, in a long dark dungeon.

What do you have to do? It's simple. Try to escape from the dungeon. But, hurry up or something bad will happen to you.

You have to find the shortest path to the exit to escape the maze.

Good luck, my friend. Your dungeon is waiting for you at codechallenge-daemons.0x14.net:4321

Input
No input needed

Output
A list of coordinates with the shortest path to the exit. The list must have the following syntax:

(x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)... (xn, yn)
Where (x0, y0) is the starting position in the maze and (xn, yn) is the final position (the exit).

For example, if your initial position is (3, 4) and the exit is at (5, 6), the following could be a good solution:

(3, 4), (3, 5), (3,6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Assuming the path is clear, of course.
