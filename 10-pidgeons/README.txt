We've discovered a security hole in the enemy communication system and we need your help to move forward.

Thanks to our secret agent, we found out the enemy was using a quite exotic physical transport layer described in the experimental RFC 1149. However, you don't need to be an expert in that RFC, since we've already been able to do a MITM attack on the communication system (with a shotgun) and extract the packets.

What do we need from you? Because we've heard you're a forensics expert, we need you to extract the information from the intercepted packets. You can download them from this URL: ICMPs pcap.

The test and submission passwords are the same.
